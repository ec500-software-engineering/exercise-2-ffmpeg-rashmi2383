Exercise-2 Part-1
It took about fifty-eight seconds to encode a one minute forty seconds video from avi to mp4 at thirty frames per second with 1 Mbps and resolution being 480p. And after varying the bit rate to two Mbps and resolution to 720p, it took about eighty-seven seconds for the same input video. This statistics is with one worker thread working on encoding. On four cores with four worker threads working on encoding four videos(same size) in parallel, it took about five minutes and thirty seconds. This is about thirty seconds of speedup achieved.
